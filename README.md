# Blinky Board

Made by **@Tanishq Goyal**

## What is the Blinky Board?

The Blinky Board is a colorful LED chaser that you can customize with your own PCB art! It uses:

- **NE555 Timer IC** in astable mode to generate clock pulses
- **CD4017 Decade Counter IC** to drive 10 LEDs in sequence
- Resistors, capacitors, and a potentiometer to control timing
- A custom PCB you design in **KiCad** and manufacture via **JLCPCB**



## How can I make my own Blinky Board?

I made this guide to teach people how to make a blinking circuit! It can be found [here](blinkyguide.md)
